The three sites represent a rural site directly affected by the local peat combustion, a semirural site, and an urban site situated downwind of the peat fires. The mass concentration of PM2.5 and the number concentration of airborne particles were as high as 1600 microg\/m3 and 1.7 x 10(5) cm(-3), respectively, in the vicinity of peat fires.

Whenever a weather related disaster involves 30 or more deaths or more than $100 million in property damage, the National Weather Service (NWS) forms a survey team to investigate the disaster and write a report of findings. All NWS survey reports on flash floods issued during 1969-81 were reviewed to determine the mortality resulting from such floods, the effect of warnings on mortality, and the circumstances contributing to death. A total of 1,185 deaths were associated with 32 flash floods, an average of 37 deaths per flash flood. The highest average number of deaths per event was associated with the four flash floods in which dams broke after heavy rains. Although there were 18 flash floods in 1977-81 and only 14 in 1969-76, the number of deaths was 22 times greater during the earlier period. Ninety-three percent of the deaths were due to drowning and 42 percent of these drownings were car related. The other drownings occurred in homes, at campsites, or when persons were crossing bridges and streams. [J. French, R. Ing, S. von Allmen, R. Wood.

Temporal associations between LUCC and disease emergence can be demonstrated early in the 20th century in Australia and in the era of EIDs (1973\u2013).\r\n","Hunter Heaivilin","Edit<\/span>","Camilo Mora"],["2221","I.

The time period was chosen to compare vegetation cover conditions prior and after the extreme October 1999 rainfall event that triggered hundreds of slope failures in the study area. Results suggested there was a significant vegetation reduction from 1989 to 1999, which was strongly expressed by an increase of 809 km2 of bare surfaces. Additionally, areas with highest vegetation density (91\u2013100%) decreased considerably, from 1245 to 363 km2, resulting in a net vegetation reduction of 70%... Land use change and land degradation are precursors to environmental hazards, such as mass movement events, that pose serious threats to regional population distributions and economic viability.\u201d Among the landsliding cases, the village of Teziutlan encountered tragic losses when 109 victims were claimed by la Aurora, a translational slide transformed into a mudflow on a slope formed by pyroclastic deposits...","Wendy Miles","Edit<\/span>","Camilo Mora"],["2230","Jonathan A.

Analyses of in situ station data and satellite observations of precipitation have identified another problematic trend: main growing-season rainfall\r\nreceipts have diminished by \u000115% in food-insecure countries clustered along the western rim of the Indian Ocean. Occurring during the main growing seasons in poor countries dependent on rain-fed agriculture, these declines are societally dangerous. Will they persist\r\nor intensify? Tracing moisture deficits upstream to an anthropogenically warming Indian Ocean leads us to conclude that further rainfall declines are likely. We present analyses suggesting that warming in the central Indian Ocean disrupts onshore moisture transports, reducing continental rainfall. Thus, late 20th-century anthropogenic Indian Ocean warming has probably already produced societally dangerous climate change by creating drought and social disruption in some of the world\u2019s most fragile food economies.

Climate data showed that from the mid-1980s\r\n Debre Zeit experienced an increase in daytime and night-\r\n time temperatures, a decrease in mean monthly rainfall\r\n and an upward trend in relative humidity. Tulu found a\r\n strong positive correlation between minimum tempera-\r\n tures and (monthly) malaria incidence and attributed the\r\n rapid increase in malaria transmission in the period\r\n 1988-1993 in part to observed climate change. Tulu\r\n accepted, however, that this relationship may be\r\n confounded by the effects of non-climate factors. Between\r\n 1972 and 1985, for example, the amount of DDT (dichlor-\r\n odiphenyltrichloroethane) used for house spraying in\r\n Debre Zeit sector fell by over 95%.

The impacts of this major drought on irrigation communities were buffered by some critical water reforms. These included: (i) well-developed water markets that allowed water trade to farmers in the greatest need; (ii) modernization of irrigation infrastructure that increased the efficiency of water delivery; and (iii) establishment of clear water entitlements for the environment that protected critical refuge habitats and populations as water availability declined. \r\nThe use of water markets was particularly critical. More than 40% of annual water allocations were traded at the height of the drought in 2007. For example, increased water prices allowed dairy farmers to sell their allocation and purchase fodder with the proceeds rather than irrigate pasture.

The effects of these changes in phytoplankton propagate up through herbivores to carnivores in the plankton food web (bottom-up control), because of tight trophic coupling.","Camilo Mora","Edit<\/span>","Michael Kantar"],["422","Singh S K,Meena H R,Kolekar D V,Singh Y P","2012","Climate Change Impacts on Livestock and Adaptation Strategies to Sustain Livestock Production","PDF<\/a>","5116","Warming","Food","Livestock","negative","Houghton et al.

The analysis reveals that 1) during the period of analysis Beijing experienced unprecedented LUCC; 2) LUCC can affect inundation extent and flood arrival time, and floods with longer return periods are more influenced; 3) LUCC can affect maximum water depth and floods with shorter return periods are more influenced; and 4) LUCC is a major flood security stressor for Beijing. It warns that those cities having experienced rapid expansion during recent decades in China are in danger of more serious floods and recommends that their actual land use patterns should be carefully assessed considering flood security.

(2013) showed mixed shoreline\r\nchange patterns over the last 40 to 50 years with examples of both\r\nerosion and accretion in the 47 atoll islands assessed. SLR did not\r\nappear to be the primary control on shoreline processes on these islands.\r\nOn uninhabited Raine Island on the Great Barrier Reef, Dawson and\r\nSmithers (2010) also found that shoreline processes were dynamic but\r\nthat island area and volume increased 6 and 4%, respectively, between\r\n1967 and 2007. Overall, these studies of observed shoreline change on\r\nreef islands conclude that for rates of change experienced over recent\r\ndecades, normal seasonal erosion and accretion processes appear to\r\npredominate over any long-term morphological trend or signal at this\r\ntime.","Daniele Spirandelli","Edit<\/span>","Wendy Miles"],["3257","Nurse, L.A., R.F.

The time period was chosen to compare vegetation cover conditions prior and after the extreme October 1999 rainfall event that triggered hundreds of slope failures in the study area. Results suggested there was a significant vegetation reduction from 1989 to 1999, which was strongly expressed by an increase of 809 km2 of bare surfaces. Additionally, areas with highest vegetation density (91\u2013100%) decreased considerably, from 1245 to 363 km2, resulting in a net vegetation reduction of 70%. Furthermore, it was possible to highlight that landslide concentration was much higher on surfaces that were bare and had low vegetation density (0\u201350%), representing 85% of hillslope instability, than on surfaces having a greater density of vegetation cover.

The results indicate that this is the case, but that the relation is opposite to common perceptions: Countries that are affected by climate-related natural disasters face a lower risk of civil war.","Keith Bettinger","Edit<\/span>","Erik Franklin"],["408","Richard Black,Nigel W Arnell,W Neil Adger,David Thomas,Andrew Geddes","2012","Migration, immobility and displacement outcomes following extreme events","PDF<\/a>","3565","Storms","Security","Migration","negative","...a paper by Carvajal and Pereira (2010) which shows that households exposed to heavy rains associated with Hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua were more likely to have migrated afterwards than those who were not exposed to heavy rains.'","Camilo Mora","Edit<\/span>","Erik Franklin"],["408","Richard Black,Nigel W Arnell,W Neil Adger,David Thomas,Andrew Geddes","2012","Migration, immobility and displacement outcomes following extreme events","PDF<\/a>","3574","Storms","Security","Displacement","positive","..in point is New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, where at the same time as several ethnic groups have failed to return because (amongst other things) of lack of job opportunities, there has been an influx of new Hispanic workers looking for new employment in construction (Cutter, in this issue).","Camilo Mora","Edit<\/span>","Kelle Freel"],["408","Richard Black,Nigel W Arnell,W Neil Adger,David Thomas,Andrew Geddes","2012","Migration, immobility and displacement outcomes following extreme events","PDF<\/a>","3577","Storms","Security","Migration","negative","In the case of Katrina, whilst estimates of displacement vary widely, a range of authors agree that a significant proportion of especially poorer residents have been unable to return, with particular ethnic groups over-represented\r\namongst those who have remained displaced for longer (Cutter, in this issue).","Camilo Mora","Edit<\/span>","Keith Bettinger"],["408","Richard Black,Nigel W Arnell,W Neil Adger,David Thomas,Andrew Geddes","2012","Migration, immobility and displacement outcomes following extreme events","PDF<\/a>","8923","Storms","Security","Migration","negative","A spatial regression analysis conducted by Saldana-Zorilla and Sandberg (2009) for Mexico shows that emigration rates were higher between 1990 and 2000 for Mexican municipalities that had a higher frequency of disasters (droughts, floods, hurricanes) during that period, but lower in surrounding municipalities.'","Erik Franklin","Edit<\/span>","Keith Bettinger"],["439","Michael A P Taylor,Michelle Philp","2010","Adapting to climate change-implications for transport infrastructure, transport systems and travel behaviour","PDF<\/a>","5215","Storms","Security","Evacuation","negative","In 1999, Hurricane Floyd triggered the third largest evacuation in US history when 2.6 million coastal residents of five states were evacuated as the hurricane approached (Wolshon & Meehan 2003).","Camilo Mora","Edit<\/span>"," Validate <\/u>"],["452","Terry Brennan","2010","The Impact of Increasing Severe Weather Events on Shelter","PDF<\/a>","5313","Storms","Security","Displacement","negative","...On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina killed more than 1,600 people, destroyed 200,000 homes and displaced about 3 million people","Camilo Mora","Edit<\/span>","Keith Bettinger"],["453","Kathryn Lane,Kizzy Charles-Guzman,Katherine Wheeler,Zaynah Abid,Nathan Graber,Thomas Matte","2013","Health effects of coastal storms and flooding in urban areas: A review and vulnerability assessment","PDF<\/a>","5326","Storms","Security","Violence","negative","In addition, two years after Katrina, the prevalence of self-reported psychological and physical intimate partner violence increased among Mississippi residents affected by the hurricane [76].","Camilo Mora","Edit<\/span>","Keith Bettinger"],["523","{UNFPA},{IIED}","2009","Population Dynamics and Climate Change","PDF<\/a>","6387","Storms","Security","Migration","negative","Poor communities in New Orleans, for example, were much more affected by Hurricane Katrina than wealthier groups, partly because of the location and conditions of their houses, and partly because of lack of insurance.

We suggest that high temperatures increase retaliation by increasing hostile attributions when teammates are hit by a pitch and by lowering inhibitions against retaliation.....We believe that the most plausible explanation for this pattern is that heat increases anger and arousal, and this psychological state changes how pitchers interpret and respond to provocation.","Camilo Mora","Edit<\/span>"," Validate <\/u>"],["3271","Richard P.

As mentioned, this allows for identification of the causal role of childhood stunting in school completion as well as in achieved height by 2000. In this case, the economic costs of stunting were estimated as a 14% reduction in lifetime earnings (Alderman 2006). This estimate is based on the expected increase of earnings if the median height for age Z-score were raised from the levels observed in the sample to\r\nzero and, thus, the reported estimate is not specific to the costs of drought.

The time period was chosen to compare vegetation cover conditions prior and after the extreme October 1999 rainfall event that triggered hundreds of slope failures in the study area. Results suggested there was a significant vegetation reduction from 1989 to 1999, which was strongly expressed by an increase of 809 km2 of bare surfaces. Additionally, areas with highest vegetation density (91\u2013100%) decreased considerably, from 1245 to 363 km2, resulting in a net vegetation reduction of 70%. Furthermore, it was possible to highlight that landslide concentration was much higher on surfaces that were bare and had low vegetation density (0\u201350%), representing 85% of hillslope instability, than on surfaces having a greater density of vegetation cover. Land use change and land degradation are precursors to environmental hazards, such as mass movement events, that pose serious threats to regional population distributions and economic viability.\u201d In October 1999 an extreme rainfall event was produced over the study area...

For other types of international financial flows, the impact of hurricanes varies according to income level. In the poorer half of the sample, hurricane exposure also leads to substantial increases in migrants\u2019 remittances, and a slightly offsetting decline in bank and trade-related lending. For this poor-country subsample, instrumental variables estimates indicate that total inflows from all sources in the three years following hurricane exposure amount to slightly more than four-fifths of estimated damages. In the richer half of the sample, by contrast, hurricane exposure stimulates inflows of new lending from multilateral institutions, but offsetting declines in private financial flows are so large that the null hypothesis of zero damage replacement cannot be rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Hunter Heaivilin","Edit<\/span>"," Validate <\/u>"],["1883","Kyle M.

Animal classes considered were: dairy cows, dairy heifers (0 to 1 yr and 1 to 2 yr), beef cows, finishing cattle, sows, market hogs, broilers, layers, and turkeys. Economic losses considered were: 1) decreased performance (feed intake, growth, milk, eggs), 2) increased mortality, and 3) decreased reproduction. USDA and industry data were used for monthly inventories of each animal class in each of the contiguous 48 states. Without heat abatement (minimum intensity), total losses across animal classes averaged $2.4 billion annually. Optimum heat abatement intensity reduced annual total losses to $1.7 billion. Annual losses averaged $897 million, $369 million, $299 million, and $128 million for dairy, beef, swine, and poultry industries, respectively. Across states, Texas, California, Oklahoma,Nebraska, and North Carolina accounted for $728 million of annual losses, or 43% of total national losses.

PREDICTIVE STUDY. KEEP IN CASE WE INCLUDE PREDICTIONS OR WANT TO CHECK OTHER BOOK CHAPTERS ON DROUGHT IN WEST AFRICA. This is a predictive study (looking at detailed projections for the possible impacts of climate change on crops in sub-Saharan West Africa). The implications provided, however, remain very broad. Do we include broad implications (i.e. reduced food availability and general economic impacts) anticipated from future climate change in this study? There is no climate change\u201d driver, and this study looks at multiple kinds of drought and changes in precipitation patterns. There might be useful information from other chapters of this book. Changes in rainfall patterns and risk of crop failure are discussed in this chapter. Agriculture is by far the most important economic activity in [sub-Saharan West Africa]. The success of this economic activity relies heavily on water availability during the growing season. For rainfed production systems timing and the amount of precipitation determine to a large extent the success of the growing season. The projected changes in the variability and total amount of rainfall are expected to worsen the situation.\u201d As indicated by the GCM-scenarios, climate change may confront dryland West Africa with even lower and more variable precipitation, higher temperatures and higher evaporation. This may result in even higher risks for crop production, with the ultimate consequences being a decrease in food availability.","Wendy Miles","Edit<\/span>"," Validate <\/u>"],["2071","M. E.

Summary: Linking of climate change adaptation with disaster risk reduction is important and starting to happen although there are significant barriers. Less developed countries and the poorest people in all countries are those most at risk and usually with the least capacity to adapt and reduce risk. A new international research initiative, Integrated Research on Disaster Risk: addressing the challenge of natural and human-induced environmental hazards (including climate change) has been established to meet the needs of providing an enhanced research base on which to develop and implement public policies.\u201d Conclusion: Integrating climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction can prove useful in responding to current and future climate change.\u201d","Wendy Miles","Edit<\/span>"," Validate <\/u>"],["1133","Yi-Ping Su,C Michael Hall,Lucie Ozanne","2013","Hospitality Industry Responses to Climate Change: A Benchmark Study of Taiwanese Tourist Hotels","PDF<\/a>","7877","Floods","NONE","NONE","Please select...","N\/A FOR MULTIPLE REASONS.

Summary: As migration theories grew in coherence and complexity over the course of the twentieth century, however, environmental considerations generally disappeared from explanations of displacement. They would reappear in a largely unconnected discourse stressing the threat of future waves of environmental migrants\u201d in the end-of-the-century context of climate change anxiety.

Summary During low water levels, habitats in river-floodplain systems are isolated from each other and from the main river. Oppositely, floods tend to connect water bodies with distinct hydrological characteristics and, as a result, ecological processes and biological communities tend to be more similar among the distinct habitats that comprise a river-floodplain system. Based on a literature review and also using unpublished data obtained in tropical floodplains, the aim of this paper is to highlight the effects of floods as a process that reduce spatial variability.\u201d","Wendy Miles","Edit<\/span>"," Validate <\/u>"],["1257","John M.

The excess costs in 2012\u201313 prices are estimated to range between AU$51,000\u2013184,000 (0\u201364) and AU$27,000\u201384,000 (65+). By 2060, these estimates will increase to 229\u20132300 and 145\u20131188 at a cost of between AU$120,000\u20131,200,000 and AU$96,000\u2013786,000 for the respective age groups.\u201d\r\n\r\n[Reviewed, not validated]","Wendy Miles","Edit<\/span>"," Validate <\/u>"],["689","K Agrawal","2008","Climate change and its impact on agriculture and food security","PDF<\/a>","7737","Heatwaves","NONE","NONE","Please select...","No data.

Focus groups with key stakeholders in three hospitals in Australia are used to construct rich picture diagrams (RPDs) of hospital infrastructure interdependencies under different extreme weather event scenarios. They show that the risks posed to hospitals by extreme weather events cannot be considered in isolation from the surrounding infrastructure, emergency management systems, health systems and communities in which they are imbedded. The new insights provided have major governance and policy implications for agencies responsible for ensuring that hospital infrastructure can continue to support the delivery of effective health services during extreme weather events.\u201d The aim of this paper was to explore the risk exposure of Australasian hospitals to extreme weather events by better understanding the complex system interdependencies within and around them.

This article is does not report original data-based findings (NO DATA), but instead contributes a FRAMEWORK FOR THINKING ABOUT MIGRATION based on the literature: \u2026this paper presents a new framework for understanding the effect of environmental change on migration. The framework identifies five families of drivers which affect migration decisions: economic, political, social, demographic and environmental drivers. The environment drives migration through mechanisms characterised as the availability and reliability of ecosystem services and exposure to hazard. Individual migration decisions and flows are affected by these drivers operating in combination, and the effect of the environment is therefore highly dependent on economic, political, social and demographic context. Environmental change has the potential to affect directly the hazardousness of place. Environmental change also affects migration indirectly, in particular through economic drivers, by changing livelihoods for example, and political drivers, through affecting conflicts over resources, for example. The proposed framework, applicable to both international and internal migration, emphasises the role of human agency in migration decisions, in particular the linked role of family and household characteristics on the one hand, and barriers and facilitators to movement on the other in translating drivers into actions.

We argue that developing an understanding of the full range of consequences from forest conversion requires understanding the effects of such conversion on both components of ecosystem services: products and processes. However, there are unavoidable challenges involved in quantifying the threats from forest conversion and their related costs to human well-being. First, most attempts to quantify the costs of forest conversion on ecosystem services will necessarily rely on specific ecological science that is often emerging, changing, or simply nonexistent. For example, the role that many species play in ecosystem processes is poorly understood. Second, given the interconnected nature of ecosystem products and processes, any attempt to quantify the effects of forest conversion must grapple with jointness in production. For example, the cost of losing a species from forest conversion must account for that species\u2019 role as both (1) a product that directly contributes to human well-being, and (2) as a component in an ecosystem process.

Most models (7 out of 10) project an increase of cropland of 10\u201325% by 2050 compared to 2005 (under constant climate), but one model projects a decrease. Pasture land expands in some models, which increase the treat on natural vegetation further. Across all models most of the cropland expansion takes place in South America and sub-Saharan Africa.

The main objective of this case study was to analyse the impact of land cover change on total storm runoff between 1950 and 2003 in a Mediterranean catchment near St Tropez, France. Aerial photographs were used to classify land cover in 3 urban categories, vineyards and bare soil, forests, and green spaces. Stream discharge was estimated using a distributed event based total runoff approach. After validating the model for a large winter event for 1982, runoff was calculated for the same event for 1950 and 2003. Land cover changes occurred mainly in the alluvial plain area.

Good review article on existing climate projections for the African continent, why they vary, what they might mean for agriculture and food security, and some of the socio-economic and political variables that will also come into play. Summary: Climate change impact assessments on agriculture are subject to large uncertainties, as demonstrated in the present review of recent studies for Africa. There are multiple reasons for differences in projections, including uncertainties in greenhouse gas emissions and patterns of climate change; assumptions on future management, aggregation, and spatial extent; and methodological differences. Still, all projections agree that climate change poses a significant risk to African agriculture. Most projections also see the possibility of increasing agricultural production under climate change, especially if suitable adaptation measures are assumed. Climate change is not the only projected pressure on African agriculture, which struggles to meet demand today and may need to feed an additional one billion individuals by 2050. Development strategies are urgently needed, but they will need to consider future climate change and its inherent uncertainties.

Accumulated evidence suggests that wealthier societies and households will be better able to adapt to a changing climate because of their greater availability of alternatives and their ability to take advantage of them.

Its major theme is the need to determine whether cases diagnosed in urban areas were imported from surrounding rural areas or resulted from transmission within the urban area. If infections are being acquired within urban areas, malaria control measures must be targeted within those urban areas to be effective. Conversely, if malaria cases are being imported from rural areas, control measures must be directed at vectors, breeding sites, and infected humans in those rural areas.","Wendy Miles","Edit<\/span>"," Validate <\/u>"],["2165","Qiongfang Li,Tao Cai,Meixiu Yu,Guobin Lu,Wei Xie,Xue Bai","2013","Investigation into the Impacts of Land-Use Change on Runoff Generation Characteristics in the Upper Huaihe River Basin, China","PDF<\/a>","7273","Natural cover change","NONE","NONE","negative","Reviewed, Water--not validated.

Model-averaged projections in Najjar et al. (2009) for the six scenarios shown in Fig. 2 range from 3 to 6 \u0002C warming by 2070\u20132099 (Fig. 5a). When the best-performing models are used, the projected warming decreases to 2\u20135 \u0002C (Fig. 5c). Similar projections were found by Hayhoe et al. (2007). ...Species that are at their southernmost range in the mid-Atlantic region will be eliminated from the Chesapeake Bay if water temperatures reach levels that are lethal or that inhibit successful reproduction. For example, the commercially important soft clam Mya arenaria in the Chesapeake Bay is near its southern distribution limit and may be extirpated if temperatures approach and remain nearw32 \u0002C (Kennedy and Mihursky, 1971).","Kelle Freel","Edit<\/span>"," Validate <\/u>"],["2383","Julia L Blanchard,Simon Jennings,Robert Holmes,James Harle,Gorka Merino,J Icarus Allen,Jason Holt,Nicholas K Dulvy,Manuel Barange","2012","Potential consequences of climate change for primary production and fish production in large marine ecosystems","PDF<\/a>","3898","Ocean climate change","NONE","NONE","negative","[Reviewed, Not Valid] We project declines of 30\u201360% in potential fish production across some important areas of tropical shelf and upwelling seas, most notably in the eastern Indo-Pacific, the northern Humboldt and the North Canary Current.\u201d\u2026 Here, we combine physical\u2013biogeochemical and size-based ecosystem models to project future effects of climate change [temperature change, and as an interacting factor changes in salinity, Haines G.

Increased nutrient inputs may accelerate the eutrophication of lagoons, especially those with low flushing rates (McComb 1995, Wazniak et al. 2007). As with sea level increases, increased turbidity will reduce light penetration and the photosynthetic activity of submerged aquatic vegetation, compounding the risk of eutrophication as nutrient dynamics are further altered (Lloret et al. 2008).

The stronger ultraviolet rays will cause the plankton in the oceans to die. Due to the fact that the lowest member in the ocean food chain is missing, far-reaching ecological changes will occur.

The stronger warming of the tropical North Atlantic relative to that of the Indo-Pacific during the most recent years drove reduced vertical wind shear over the Atlantic and is thus responsible for the strong hurricane activity observed. In 2006, however, the temperature difference between the tropical North Atlantic and the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans is much reduced, which explains the relatively weak hurricane season... Furthermore, it is known that anomalously high tropical Pacific SST also drives enhanced vertical wind shear over the tropical Atlantic. Figure 3 depicts maps of linear regression coefficients of the vertical wind shear upon the SSTs in the three tropical oceans from the T106 integration.

The use of different habitats by these visitors is also\r\nassessed via an analysis of walking routes undertaken in a Geographical Information System. From this,\r\nan assessment is made of the likely present day biodiversity impacts arising from different coastal users,\r\nand how these may change under a modified climate. This study finds that whilst higher temperatures\r\nare expected to increase visitor numbers, warmer weather may encourage greater participation in low\r\nimpact activities such as bathing.","Keith Bettinger","Edit<\/span>"," Validate <\/u>"],["220","A.

This is a political analysis based on a large review of resources and not original data collection. \r\n\r\nThe article [provides] an overview of\u2026 current and future challenges in terms of global food and water systems. The major focus of the argument has been on how resource scarcity is a contested and subjective concept\u2026\u201d The article makes four points: (1) that resource scarcity as a driver of conflict is inconclusive especially at regional and national levels (2) most insecurities surrounding water and food are explained by political power, social and gender relations; (3) global trade has enabled national food and water security, but that is now threatened by increasing food prices, food sovereignty movements and land \u2018grabbing\u2019 (4) and that water and food security will face major challenges under conditions of climate change.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis article provides a review of theoretical debates on food insecurity, and explains why environmental change interplay with other factors (e.g., globalization, varying levels of power relations) to create situations in which people are food and water secure despite a regional shortage of food\/water, or vice versa. \r\n\r\nThis is a good resource to contextualize the relationship between food\/water security and environmental change, explaining the importance of a range of non-environmental factors for how human society will cope with resource scarcity.","Wendy Miles","Edit<\/span>"," Validate <\/u>"],["269","Thomas W.

This paper analyses projections from a range of literature on electricity systems in Europe in the 21st Century. There is a lot of speculation involved, including (1) changes in technologies (or lack thereof) in the 21st century, and (2) changes in climate variables across the landscape (e.g. rainfall patterns, warming, etc.). Given that it is a review paper (although the literature is assessed for patterns), that the articles assessed are predictive, and that the driver of change is climate change\u201d (not a category in-and-of-itself in the Mora et al review), I\u2019m not sure where to put this in the matrix. ARTICLE EXERPT: This study conducted a systematic literature review to collate consistent patterns of impacts of CV&C on electricity systems in Europe. We found that, in the absence of adaptation and for current capacity, thermal electricity generation will decrease for the near term to mid-21st century (NT-MC) and the end of the 21st century (EC). In contrast, renewable electricity generation will increase for hydroelectricity in Northern Europe (NT-MC and EC), for solar electricity in Germany (NT-MC) and the United Kingdom and Spain (NT-MC and EC) and for wind electricity in the Iberian Peninsula (NT-MC) and over the Baltic and Aegean Sea (NT-MC and EC). Although the knowledge frontier in this area has advanced, the evidence available remains patchy.

Managers were asked in an open-ended question if any changes in climate had occurred in their area. Almost one third (9 out of 31) indicated that they had not observed any change in climate over the period they had worked at the ski area. Although most respondents based their answer on their personal perception of climate, some had investigated local climate trends using climate station records.

(ii) Medium-term climatic adversity has frequently caused similar health, social, and sometimes political consequences. (iii) Infectious disease epidemics have often occurred in association with briefer episodes of temperature shifts, food shortages, impoverishment, and social disruption.

We review studies projecting the impacts of climate change on air quality and studies projecting the impacts of these changes on morbidity and mortality.\u201d Climate change could affect local to regional air quality through changes in chemical reaction rates, boundary layer heights that affect vertical mixing of pollutants, and changes in synoptic airflow patterns that govern pollutant transport. Sources of uncertainty include the degree of future climate change, future emissions of air pollutants and their precursors, and how population vulnerability may change in the future. Given these uncertainties, projections suggest that climate change will increase concentrations of tropospheric ozone, at least in high-income countries when precursor emissions are held constant, which would increase morbidity and mortality. Few projections are available for low- and middle-income countries. The evidence is less robust for PM, primarily because few studies have been conducted.\u201d An increase in ozone concentrations would affect the ability of regions to achieve air quality targets.\u201d","Wendy Miles","Edit<\/span>"," Validate <\/u>"],["2175","E.

Importantly, US leadership toward sustainable security will\r\nenhance freedom, justice, and human dignity\u201d around the Earth; grow the\r\ncommunity of democracies\u201d;2\r\n sustain stability, prosperity, and security; and\r\nmake it possible for the global community to avoid the unmanageable and\r\nmanage the unavoidable\u201d consequences of global climate change.\r\n","Keith Bettinger","Edit<\/span>"," Validate <\/u>"],["2471","Wallace S.
