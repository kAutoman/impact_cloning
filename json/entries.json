Information is assembled from studies to provide an indication of the potential for water supply contamination by different constituents following wildfires. Large increases in exports and concentrations of some constituents after wildfire indicate the potential for substantial impacts on water supply. Maximum reported concentrations of total suspended solids in streams for the first year after fire ranged from 11 to 500,000 mg L1. Similarly, there was a large range in first year post-fire stream exports of total N (1.1?27 kg ha1 year1) and total P (0.03?3.2 kg ha1 year1), representing a multiple change of 0.3?431 times unburned, while NO3 exports of 0.04?13.0 kg ha1 year1 (3?250 times unburned) have been reported. NO3 , NO2 , and NH3\/NH4 concentrations in streams and lakes or reservoirs may increase after wildfire but appear to present a generally low risk of exceeding drinking water guidelines. \r\nThe limited observations of trace element concentrations in streams after wildfire found high levels (well over guidelines) of Fe, Mn, As, Cr, Al, Ba, and Pb, which were associated with highly elevated sediment concentrations. In contrast, Cu, Zn, and Hg were below or only slightly above guideline values. wildfire effects on dissolved organic carbon were generally minor.

The analysis reveals that 1) during the period of analysis Beijing experienced unprecedented LUCC; 2) LUCC can affect inundation extent and flood arrival time, and floods with longer return periods are more influenced; 3) LUCC can affect maximum water depth and floods with shorter return periods are more influenced; and 4) LUCC is a major flood security stressor for Beijing. It warns that those cities having experienced rapid expansion during recent decades in China are in danger of more serious floods and recommends that their actual land use patterns should be carefully assessed considering flood security.

The framework identifies five families of drivers which affect migration decisions: economic, political, social, demographic and environmental drivers. The environment drives migration through mechanisms characterised as the availability and reliability of ecosystem services and exposure to hazard. Individual migration decisions and flows are affected by these drivers operating in combination, and the effect of the environment is therefore highly dependent on economic, political, social and demographic context. Environmental change has the potential to affect directly the hazardousness of place. Environmental change also affects migration indirectly, in particular through economic drivers, by changing livelihoods for example, and political drivers, through affecting conflicts over resources, for example.

We argue that developing an understanding of the full range of consequences from forest conversion requires understanding the effects of such conversion on both components of ecosystem services: products and processes. However, there are unavoidable challenges involved in quantifying the threats from forest conversion and their related costs to human well-being. First, most attempts to quantify the costs of forest conversion on ecosystem services will necessarily rely on specific ecological science that is often emerging, changing, or simply nonexistent. For example, the role that many species play in ecosystem processes is poorly understood. Second, given the interconnected nature of ecosystem products and processes, any attempt to quantify the effects of forest conversion must grapple with jointness in production. For example, the cost of losing a species from forest conversion must account for that species\u2019 role as both (1) a product that directly contributes to human well-being, and (2) as a component in an ecosystem process.

Four mechanisms\u2014the displacement, rebound, cascade, and remittance effects\u2014that are amplified by economic globalization accelerate land conversion. A few developing countries have managed a land use transition (i.e. from a trend towards less forest to more forest) over the recent decades that simultaneously increased their forest cover and agricultural production.

The main objective of this case study was to analyse the impact of land cover change on total storm runoff between 1950 and 2003 in a Mediterranean catchment near St Tropez, France. Aerial photographs were used to classify land cover in 3 urban categories, vineyards and bare soil, forests, and green spaces. Stream discharge was estimated using a distributed event based total runoff approach. After validating the model for a large winter event for 1982, runoff was calculated for the same event for 1950 and 2003. Land cover changes occurred mainly in the alluvial plain area. Total gauge catchment urban area increased from 30.1 ha to 393.8 between 1950 and 2003 at the expense mainly of agricultural land, but this was compensated in part by an increase in grassed area.

CONTEXT ARTICLE ON FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE AND FOOD SECURITY IN AFRICA. GOOD CITATIONS. Good review article on existing climate projections for the African continent, why they vary, what they might mean for agriculture and food security, and some of the socio-economic and political variables that will also come into play. Summary: Climate change impact assessments on agriculture are subject to large uncertainties, as demonstrated in the present review of recent studies for Africa. There are multiple reasons for differences in projections, including uncertainties in greenhouse gas emissions and patterns of climate change; assumptions on future management, aggregation, and spatial extent; and methodological differences. Still, all projections agree that climate change poses a significant risk to African agriculture. Most projections also see the possibility of increasing agricultural production under climate change, especially if suitable adaptation measures are assumed. Climate change is not the only projected pressure on African agriculture, which struggles to meet demand today and may need to feed an additional one billion individuals by 2050. Development strategies are urgently needed, but they will need to consider future climate change and its inherent uncertainties. Science needs to show how existing synergies between climate change adaptation and development can be exploited.\u201d",""],["625","Thomas Peterson","2008","CLIMATE CHANGE AND TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE","2008_Unknown_Peterson.pdf","7240","4","8","22","negative","No data.

This paper analyses projections from a range of literature on electricity systems in Europe in the 21st Century. There is a lot of speculation involved, including (1) changes in technologies (or lack thereof) in the 21st century, and (2) changes in climate variables across the landscape (e.g. rainfall patterns, warming, etc.). Given that it is a review paper (although the literature is assessed for patterns), that the articles assessed are predictive, and that the driver of change is climate change\u201d (not a category in-and-of-itself in the Mora et al review), I\u2019m not sure where to put this in the matrix. ARTICLE EXERPT: This study conducted a systematic literature review to collate consistent patterns of impacts of CV&C on electricity systems in Europe. We found that, in the absence of adaptation and for current capacity, thermal electricity generation will decrease for the near term to mid-21st century (NT-MC) and the end of the 21st century (EC). In contrast, renewable electricity generation will increase for hydroelectricity in Northern Europe (NT-MC and EC), for solar electricity in Germany (NT-MC) and the United Kingdom and Spain (NT-MC and EC) and for wind electricity in the Iberian Peninsula (NT-MC) and over the Baltic and Aegean Sea (NT-MC and EC).

Much of the loss was due to structural changes within agriculture, such as the conversion of paddy fields into orchards or fish ponds. However, a substantial portion of the loss was due to industrial and urban expansion (Ellis et al., 2000). Much of the loss occurred in the coastal and central regions, while the western region experienced a small gain in cultivated area\u2026.The conversion of fertile land to non-agricultural uses is the primary threat to China\u2019s continued capacity to produce sufficient cereals (Lichtenberg and Ding, 2008).\u201d\r\n",""],["1085","Bakr M {Aly Ahmed}","2015","Social and Cultural Impacts of Tourism Growth in Coastal Environments and the Potential for Sustainability: Case Study of Egypt and USA","2015_International Journal of Arts and Humanities_Aly Ahmed.pdf","7660","7","8","22","Please select...","Economic, social and culture impacts--but no discussion of climate or environment.",""],["1086","Paul Kirshen,Matthias Ruth,William Anderson","2008","Interdependencies of urban climate change impacts and adaptation strategies: a case study of Metropolitan Boston USA","2008_Climatic Change_Kirshen, Ruth, Anderson.pdf","7588","7","8","22","Please select...","Projections and planning.",""],["1088","Torkil Jonch-Clausen,Jens Fugl","2001","Firming up the Conceptual Basis of Integrated Water Resources Management","2001_Water Resources Development_Jonch-Clausen, Fugl.pdf","7661","7","8","22","Please select...","N\/A.

REVIEW ARTICLE. This is a review article connecting climate change with the need for increased disaster preparedness. It has MANY GOOD CITATIONS of articles with specific examples of disasters resulting from Mora et al.\u2019s list of drivers\u201d. Summary: Linking of climate change adaptation with disaster risk reduction is important and starting to happen although there are significant barriers. Less developed countries and the poorest people in all countries are those most at risk and usually with the least capacity to adapt and reduce risk. A new international research initiative, Integrated Research on Disaster Risk: addressing the challenge of natural and human-induced environmental hazards (including climate change) has been established to meet the needs of providing an enhanced research base on which to develop and implement public policies.\u201d Conclusion: Integrating climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction can prove useful in responding to current and future climate change.\u201d",""],["1133","Yi-Ping Su,C Michael Hall,Lucie Ozanne","2013","Hospitality Industry Responses to Climate Change: A Benchmark Study of Taiwanese Tourist Hotels","2013_Asia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research_Su, Hall, Ozanne.pdf","7877","7","8","22","Please select...","N\/A FOR MULTIPLE REASONS.

The potential for agricultural systems to adapt to climate change is at once both promising and poorly understood. This chapter reviews possible producer and consumer responses to a changing climate, the ability of these responses to offset otherwise negative impacts on food security, and the role of public and private institutions in investing in adaptation where individual responses are insufficient. Accumulated evidence suggests that wealthier societies and households will be better able to adapt to a changing climate because of their greater availability of alternatives and their ability to take advantage of them. Accordingly, investments that improve options for the poor, such as improved agricultural production technologies, financial instruments, and off-farm income opportunities, will likely be critical for adapting food security to a changing climate.\u201d",""],["1237","Kristie L.

The stronger warming of the tropical North Atlantic relative to that of the Indo-Pacific during the most recent years drove reduced vertical wind shear over the Atlantic and is thus responsible for the strong hurricane activity observed. In 2006, however, the temperature difference between the tropical North Atlantic and the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans is much reduced, which explains the relatively weak hurricane season... Furthermore, it is known that anomalously high tropical Pacific SST also drives enhanced vertical wind shear over the tropical Atlantic.

Do we include broad implications (i.e. reduced food availability and general economic impacts) anticipated from future climate change in this study? There is no climate change\u201d driver, and this study looks at multiple kinds of drought and changes in precipitation patterns. There might be useful information from other chapters of this book. Changes in rainfall patterns and risk of crop failure are discussed in this chapter. Agriculture is by far the most important economic activity in [sub-Saharan West Africa]. The success of this economic activity relies heavily on water availability during the growing season. For rainfed production systems timing and the amount of precipitation determine to a large extent the success of the growing season. The projected changes in the variability and total amount of rainfall are expected to worsen the situation.\u201d As indicated by the GCM-scenarios, climate change may confront dryland West Africa with even lower and more variable precipitation, higher temperatures and higher evaporation.

We review studies projecting the impacts of climate change on air quality and studies projecting the impacts of these changes on morbidity and mortality.\u201d Climate change could affect local to regional air quality through changes in chemical reaction rates, boundary layer heights that affect vertical mixing of pollutants, and changes in synoptic airflow patterns that govern pollutant transport. Sources of uncertainty include the degree of future climate change, future emissions of air pollutants and their precursors, and how population vulnerability may change in the future. Given these uncertainties, projections suggest that climate change will increase concentrations of tropospheric ozone, at least in high-income countries when precursor emissions are held constant, which would increase morbidity and mortality. Few projections are available for low- and middle-income countries. The evidence is less robust for PM, primarily because few studies have been conducted.\u201d An increase in ozone concentrations would affect the ability of regions to achieve air quality targets.\u201d",""],["2175","E.

A shift in relative fortunes took place beginning in the late 1970s. Recent production of salmon has been so high in Alaska that prices have fallen drastically and much of the product cannot be sold profitably. Conversely, salmon production along the West Coast has fallen so low that the Pacific Fishery Management Council recently considered an option that would eliminate ocean sport and commercial harvest in 1992 from California to Washington. a number of physical variables associated with atmospheric conditions (eg, temperature, coastal upwelling) and the biological responses of fish in the Alaska and California currents are out of phase (Tabata 1991; Hollowed and Wooster 1991}.

These modifications of land surface characteristics have promoted the development of urban heat island phenomenon both at the urban canopy and urban boundary layers.\r\n\r\nUrban heat island and its urban-induced convergence zone where the precipitation occurs are responsible for high\r\nozone concentration.

While VOC and NOx\r\nemissions, the two ingredients of ground-level ozone, showed\r\ndistinct differences between the core and the periphery of the\r\ncity, their effects on cardiovascular and chronic lower respiratory diseases were weak when their spatial patterns of disease incidence rates at the county levels were compared.",""],["2251","D.
